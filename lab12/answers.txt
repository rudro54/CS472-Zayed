What is Libuv ?
Answer : Libuv is a multi platform support library with a focus on asynchronous I/O.
It does maintain Node JS's asynchronous file and file system operations. Libuv is
originally developed to provide asynchronous I/O that includes asynchronous TCP &
UDP sockets, (famous) event loop, asynchronous DNS resolution, file system read / write
and etc. Libuv is wrtitten in C. 

2. Explain the difference between setImmediate(f) and setTimeout(f, Time)?
Answer : setImmediate executes in the check phase of the event loop and setTimeout
executes in the timers phase . setImmediate executes after I/O events , when you
want to run a callback I/O. setTimeout executes after a minimum delay >=1ms when 
you want to callback after a dealy. 


3.Explain the difference between process.nextTick(f) and setImmediate(f)?
Answer : process.nextTick(f) runs before the event loop continues(microtask queue) and setImmediate(f)
runs in the check phase of the event loop. process.nextTick() executes setImmediately after current 
operations, even before promises where as setImmediate executes after I/O and timers . process.nextTick
used for critical urgent logic after current task but before any I/O . setImmediate schedule logic after
I/O events . 


Output : 
nextTick 1
Promise.resolve 1
Promise.resolve 2
nextTick inside Promise
this is setTimeout
data printout (input text)
this is setImmediate 1
this is setImmediate 2
Promise.resolve inside setImmediate
readablStream close event
this is setTimeout
